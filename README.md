Netflix clone , This React app has multiple pages: Home,
Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in,
and sign up. The sign in will connect to Firebase when a
user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, we will use
Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth
database. I build this app using React and uses Styled
Components for all the styling we implement. And im use
react hoock [useState, useContext, useEffect].
